# circuitpython_edgebadge_audio_spectrum_waterfall_display
Audio spectrum display for the Adafruit edge badge, using a custom FFT in circuit python!
Basically a audio spectrogram written all in CircuitPyhton.

The Adafruit edge badge needs to have pin D12 jumpered to D6, and pin TX jumpered to D5 
in order for the PDM library to access the microphone on the board.
